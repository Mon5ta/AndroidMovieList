# AndroidMovieList
This is a simple example of architectural components of MVVM in android development (java). The logic is that we want to represent a list of movies which are coming from an API (of our choice) and we view the list using Retrofit2, Live Data, RecyclerView and Glide

If you detect issues with non-existing apis or anything else you can easily choose your api that has to be the same format with the included-file which exists in AndroidMovieList/movies.json directory. (note: you have to upload this file to your server and change the URL inside the RetroInstance class of network package or create a localhost server on your computer if you have not your own server)
